<h1>How bd works</h1>
Post describing how the program <a
	href="https://github.com/vigneshwaranr/bd">bd</a> works. It is a convenient
way to go back to one of the parent directories when you are deep in the
directory structure. This program is a shell script.
<h2>Main functions</h2>
The code functionality is logically divided into 3 functions :
<ol>
	<li>help_msg : Prints some text to help the user.</li>
	<li>usage_error : Prints some text to report that the program has not been
		used incorrectly and directs the user to the github site for
		information on how to use the program.</li>
	<li>newpwd : This function contains the main functionality of the
		program.</li>
</ol>

The program execution starts at around line 56 and uses and if condition to
check if condition to call one of usage_error or newpwd.
