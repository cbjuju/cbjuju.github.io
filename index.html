<h1>How bd works</h1>
Post describing how the program <a
	href="https://github.com/vigneshwaranr/bd">bd</a> works. It is a convenient
way to go back to one of the parent directories when you are deep in the
directory structure. This program is a shell script.
<h2>Main functions</h2>
The code functionality is logically divided into 3 functions :
<ol>
	<li>help_msg : Prints some text to help the user.</li>
	<li>usage_error : Prints some text to report that the program has not been
		used incorrectly and directs the user to the github site for
		information on how to use the program.</li>
	<li>newpwd : This function contains the main functionality of the
		program.</li>
</ol>

The program execution starts at around line 56 and uses and if condition to
check if condition to call one of usage_error or newpwd.
<h2>newdpwd()</h2>
This function stores the main functionality of the tool. It takes the name of
the folder as input and returns the absolute path of the folder as output. This
is done on a case by case basis using regular expressions. There are four
cases corresponding to four possible values of the flag passed in from the
command line :
<ul>
	<li> -s
	<li> -si
	<li> -?
	<li> *
</ul>

<h1>Neovim</h1>
